 * Applies a non-state Store patch before the Store is started.

 * `collectEvent()` are used. Once the Store has consumed configuration values (e.g. `stateSaver`
 * is consumed once `currentState` is read; `coroutineContext` is consumed once a coroutine is
 * launched), patches that target those values will fail.
