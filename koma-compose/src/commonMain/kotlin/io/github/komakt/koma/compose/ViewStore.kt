/**
 * Compose-friendly state holder for a [Store].
 *
 * A [ViewStore] is tied to a Store instance and exposes its latest state, a dispatch function,
 * and access to the Store's event stream.
 *
 * When created by [rememberViewStore], the same [ViewStore] instance is retained while the
 * underlying Store instance remains the same. Its [state] property always reads the latest
 * collected Store state from Compose-managed state.
 *
 * The secondary constructor that accepts a plain [state] creates a standalone holder with a fixed
 * initial value, which is useful for previews, tests, and other non-Store-backed usage.
 *
 * @param stateRef Compose state that always holds the latest Store state
 * @param dispatch Function to dispatch actions
 * @param eventFlow Flow used to receive one-off events
